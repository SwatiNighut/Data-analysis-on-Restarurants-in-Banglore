Conclusion: 
The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the aggregate rating of each restaurant, establishment of different types of restaurant at different places. Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they don't have time to cook for themselves. With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study this data.This will help customer to choose the restaurant according to location, budget, type of cuisine and other facilities like online order,table booking,restaurant types etc.
